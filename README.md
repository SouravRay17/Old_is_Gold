# Introduction
Welcome to the Old is Gold Image Colorization project! This project aims to take black and white images and bring them to life by adding color to them. It utilizes advanced image processing and deep learning techniques to analyze the content of grayscale images and produce vibrant, colorized versions.

Colourization of black and white images can be a fascinating task, especially when it allows us to relive historical moments or rejuvenate cherished memories. Whether you're a photography enthusiast, a history buff, or simply curious about the capabilities of modern computer vision, this project offers an exciting opportunity to explore the realm of image colorization.

# Features
Automatic black-and-white image colourization
High-quality colourization using deep learning models
User-friendly command-line interface
Support for popular image formats (e.g., JPEG, PNG)

# Requirements
Before running the Old is Gold project, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.6+
TensorFlow (2.x)
OpenCV
NumPy


You can install these packages using pip by running the following command:


pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy
# Installation
Clone the project repository from GitHub:

git clone https://github.com/SouravRay17/old-is-gold.git
cd old-is-gold
Install the required dependencies as mentioned in the previous section.

Download the pre-trained deep learning model for colourization (if applicable) from the project's release page or provided sources.

Place the pre-trained model in the appropriate directory within the project structure.

Usage
To colourize black and white images using the Old is Gold project, follow these steps:

Navigate to the project directory:

cd /path/to/old-is-gold
Run the colourization script with the path to your grayscale image as an argument:


python colorize.py --input /path/to/your/image.jpg
The script will process the image and save the colourized version in the same directory with the filename "_colourized" appended to the original filename. For example, if your input image is "photo.jpg," the colorized version will be saved as "photo_colorized.jpg."

Enjoy your beautifully colourized image!
